This article examines trends in Billboard charted songs from 2000 to 2025, using Spotify and Billboard top 100 data, using Python, it explores how these changes reflect shifts in music and society as a whole. Have we really become a quick fix society? The music industry tells us YES.

# The quick fix - Music evolution mirroring society's evolution
We always hear that in today's world people have shorter attention spans, they crave quick fixes and the impressions and input is constant.
Music, as we know, is a mirror of society, and if that is the case, the music that is being produced should support that statement.

Have we really become a quick fix society? The music industry tells us YES.

Music behaviour has changed. Above we see audio features of popular chart songs, by year, released between 2000 and 2025.
These are songs that have spent at least 10 weeks on the charts at any point.
When looking at the makeup of these songs by year, shorter songs with higher tempo is being released. Likely catering to the landscape of social media and content creation. 
Gone are the days of an 8 minute Bohemian Rapsody.

As society from 2000 to 2025 gradually shifts to a digital world, a harsher world, a faster pace, with constant input and feedback loops and short attention spans, so does the music.
The trends in the audio features of the popular songs released during this time follows the same pattern.

People need songs that can be used in a TikTok or a reel, and that most likely play into the behaviour we see in the plots.
This also supports the claim that people crave quick fixes and are growing more and more impatient. We don't want to wait for a slow developing track.
Society has also gradually become less restrictive about explicit content over this period, which again is evident when looking at the released music. Possibly because popular social media platforms have become less regulated, and because explicit content is more easily accessible now than ever. As already stated, music is a mirror of society.

The avg valence of songs from 2015 and onwards is much lower than the start of the millenium. Are the quick fix society becoming more sad and melancholic? Do we crave more emotional complexity? Since music is a mirror of society, signs point towards yes.

# The most popular song
Let us look at the most popular song, Blinding Lights, by The Weekend. Which spent 90 weeks on the charts and averaged a chart position of less than 12th position during that time.
Can we see the same tendencies there?¶

<img width="1055" height="858" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-25 at 11 13 13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d677d9-47b2-45a9-bdde-2f29fc74f15c" />

We saw in earlier analysis that popular songs, just like the modern world, are becoming faster and faster during the last 25 years.
The popular songs are also becoming shorter and shorter, just like people's attention spans.
The valence is getting lower and lower and the explicit content is increasing.

To me it is therefore not a surprise to look at these plots.
- Blinding Lights has a way higher tempo at 171 BPM than the avg of all songs. In fact it is much higher than any of the yearly averages we looked at in my previous plots.
- The song is also significantly shorter than the avg song, and shorter than the majority of yearly averages we looked at earlier.
- The valence is also much lower at 0.33 than the avg of all songs, and any of the yearly averages for popular songs we looked at previously.
- It is not however deemed to be explicit, which as pointed to previously, is also increasing amongst popular songs on a yearly basis.

So on average popular songs are getting faster, shorter and a lesser valence score over time, from 2000 to 2025. The most popular song out of them all, Blinding Lights released in 2020, is hammering that point home. Being super fast, shorter than average and has a very very low valence.
Important to remember is that valence is not a measure of the lyrical meaning, rather how happy or cheerful the tracks sounds.

# The most popular artists
Let's look at the most popular artists based on Spotify's popularity score.
Do they strengthen our thesis?¶

<img width="997" height="465" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-25 at 11 13 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419f9bd4-577c-47e7-96f0-c55a4696552f" />

Average valence shows a moderate negative correlation with both popularity and weeks on chart, suggesting that more successful and popular artists tend to release music with lower overall positivity.
The relationship is moderate, but it does mean that decreased valence is associated with success.

We also see in the hue (the orange dots) that the artists that have topped the charts at some point on average lean towards the lower side of the valence scale.
So artists that become popular with the public are creating music that reflects modern society.

# Now let's look at the songs created by the 50 most popular artists, compared to the rest.

<img width="1053" height="856" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-25 at 11 13 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dfe8de6-e6e8-4bda-933a-0f4c9eef092f" />

The top 50 most popular artists on Spotify are on average making songs that are:
- Slightly faster than the average of the other artists
- Slightly shorter than the average of the other artists
- Significantly lower valence than the average of other artists
- A lot more explicit songs than the averge of other artists

So again, the same behaviour can be seen here. The artists that currently are the most popular on Spotify make faster, shorter, sader/more melancholy songs and include more explicit content compared to the average other artist. Reflecting a world that, like their music, has become faster paced, shorter in terms of things like attention and patience and more harsh.

# In summary
Over the last 25 years, music has changed in ways that closely mirror changes in society. Songs have gradually become shorter and faster, a quick fix, which fits a society that have graduated towards having less time, moving at a faster pace and having shorter attention spans and patience.

Music has evolved towards having less and less valence and more and more explicit content. Reflecting a world shaped by digital platforms, where we are more easily subject to the harsh brutalities and realities.

Music is a mirror of society, and looking at the first quarter of this century it tells an interesting story about how we have changed. Let's wait and see what the next 25 years of music tell us about our selves.
