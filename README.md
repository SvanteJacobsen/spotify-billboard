# The quick fix - Music evolution mirroring society's evolution
We always hear that in today's world people have shorter attention spans, they crave quick fixes and the impressions and input is constant.
Music, as we know, is a mirror of society, and if that is the case, the music that is being produced should support that statement.

Music behaviour has changed. Above we see audio features of popular chart songs, by year, released between 2000 and 2025.
These are songs that have spent at least 10 weeks on the charts at any point.
When looking at the makeup of these songs by year, shorter songs with higher tempo is being released. Likely catering to the landscape of social media and content creation. Gone are the days of an 8 minute Bohemian Rapsody.
As society from 2000 to 2025 gradually shifts to a digital world, a harsher world, a faster pace, with constant input and feedback loops and short attention spans, so does the music.
The trends in the audio features of the popular songs released during this time follows the same pattern.
People need songs that can be used in a TikTok or a reel, and that most likely play into the behaviour we see in the plots.
This also supports the claim that people crave quick fixes and are growing more and more impatient. We don't want to wait for a slow developing track.
Society has also gradually become less restrictive about explicit content over this period, which again is evident when looking at the released music. Possibly because popular social media platforms have become less regulated, and because explicit content is more easily accessible now than ever. As already stated, music is a mirror of society.
The avg valence of songs from 2015 and onwards is much lower than the start of the millenium. Are the quick fix society becoming more sad and melancholic? Do we crave more emotional complexity? Since music is a mirror of society, signs point towards yes.
